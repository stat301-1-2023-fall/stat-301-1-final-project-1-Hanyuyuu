### Data Cleaning

Although my dataset came fairly complete and mostly tidy from the source, it lacked important metadata about each variable as it was stored in a `.csv` file. My cleaning of the data involved going through the dataset to find variables which would be useful to convert to into factors, logicals, and datetimes. To do so I used a series of `for` loops inspired by L11 Exercise 10.

### My progress

To begin my EDA, I borrowed code from L11 Exercise 9 to generate quick bar charts and histograms to visualize the distributions of all factor and numerical variables. My research question from the first progress memo was investigating the **primary predictors of traffic incidents in Chicago,** which I did not realize was recorded as a variable already in the dataset. Below are very rough barplots of the distribution of the primary and secondary contributory causes of crashes in the dataset:

![](plots/factor/prim_contributory_cause_distribution.png)

![](plots/factor/sec_contributory_cause_distribution.png)

Seeing that the primary and secondary contributory causes recorded in this dataset were either not-applicable or undetermined was quite unsatisfying. The lack of unexpected results was a trend found in the distribution of lighting conditions, road defects, and most severe injury.

![](plots/factor/lighting_condition_distribution.png) ![](plots/factor/road_defect_distribution.png)
![](plots/factor/most_severe_injury_distribution.png)

```{r}
#| label: cor-matrix
#| echo: false

traffic |> 
  filter(most_severe_injury == "FATAL") |> 
  select(where(is.numeric), -lane_cnt, -(injuries_total:injuries_unknown), -beat_of_occurrence) |> 
  cor() |> 
  round(digits = 3) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

Such plots reveal that most crashes, fortunately, do not appear to be due to extreme weather or road conditions, and most are not incredibly serious.

Thus, I would like to change the direction of my EDA from this point onwards into investigating the **primary predictors of particular intensities of crashes**, based on the `most_severe_injury` plot above, **and particular types of crashes**, based upon the `prim_contributory_cause` plot. For example, what conditions correlate with crashes due to a failure to reduce vehicle speed? How intense, typically are these kinds of crashes? Viewing the dataset with a more specific lense may help me develop more concrete findings. One particular direction I can envision myself taking this project is looking solely at "failure to yield right-of-way" crashes. Such crashes might be due to an inability to see an oncoming car or pedestrian, and as I will be integrating map data into this project, I may be able to find certain areas where these types of crashes are concentrated, which could elucidate design faults in the roads at these areas.

### Other Interesting Findings

The only two datetime variables in this dataset record when a crash occurs and when it is reported to police, so I thought it would be interesting to subtract the two and look at delay trends. I found that within each unit of time (within a day, week, year, two years, etc.) delays are concentrated towards the beginning of that period of time, shown by the right-skewness of the plots below. However, if one looks more closely at longer periods of time, there is a curious grouping pattern which reveals that crashes are reported at "round" intervals of time (1 complete day, 2 complete days, 1 complete year, etc.) after the crash. This is particularly evident in the middle plot which shows the distribution of reporting delays throughout the week.

```{r}
#| label: delay-plots
#| echo: false
dy <- traffic |> 
    filter(delay_bins == "day") |> 
    ggplot(aes(delay)) +
    geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Day")

wk <- traffic |> 
    filter(delay_bins == "week") |> 
    ggplot(aes(delay)) +
    geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Week")

yr <- ggplot(traffic, aes(delay)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 250) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 25)) +
   labs(title = "All crashes")

dy + wk + yr
```

### Next Steps

My next steps are to look closer at multivariate analyses using the guiding question presented above and to work on mapping the data using the `tigris` package as I mentioned in the first memo. My guiding question for the multivariate analyses **will be what are the best predictors of different severities and types of crashes**, based on the `most_severe_injury_distribution` shown above.

I will spend some time over Thanksgiving Break to continue my analyses and joining the `tigris` data with crashes which have recorded longitudes and latitudes, and then spend reading week fine-tuning my key visualizations and the final presentation of my work. I intend to make the early-submission deadline.
