## Basic repo setup for final project

My final project investigates the primary causes of traffic crashes in Chicago, using a dataset from the City of Chicago.

All data is stored within the `data` subfolder, with cleaned data stored in `data` and raw data stored `data/raw`. Given the large size of the dataset, raw and cleaned data have been ignored in .gitignore and not pushed to the Github, but citations in the form of links to the original data are provided in the progress memos and final report.

All plots generated in this project ar found in the `plots` subfolder, which contains univariate distributions separated by data type, and the `plots/final` subfolder houses plots used in the final report.

Data wrangling and visualization are housed in R scripts beginning with numbers 1-5.

Progress memos, the final report, and executive summaries are written using Quarto Documents, and the .html files corresponding with each document are also housed here.
